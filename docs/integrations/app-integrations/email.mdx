This document outlines the process of connecting an email account to MindsDB.

## Connection

This handler was implemented using standard Python libraries: `email`, `imaplib`, and `smtplib`.

The Email handler is initialized with the following required parameters:

* `email` stores an email address used for authentication.
* `password` stores a password used for authentication.

<Tip>
At the moment, the handler has only been tested with Gmail accounts.

To use the handler on a Gmail account, you must create an app password following [this instruction](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
</Tip>

Additionally, the following optional parameters can be passed:

* `smtp_server` used to send emails. Defaults to `smtp.gmail.com`.
* `smtp_port` used to send emails. Defaults to `587`.
* `imap_server` used to receive emails. Defaults to `imap.gmail.com`.

To connect your email account to MindsDB, use the below `CREATE DATABASE` statement:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE email_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'email',
PARAMETERS = {
  "email": "youremail@gmail.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
};
```

It creates a database that comes with the `emails` table.

## Usage

Now you can query for emails like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM email_datasource.emails;
```

And you can apply filters like this:

```sql
SELECT id, to, subject, body
FROM email_datasource.emails
WHERE subject = 'MindsDB'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5;
```

Or, write emails like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO email_datasource.emails(to, subject, body)
VALUES ("toemail@email.com", "MindsDB", "Hello from MindsDB!");
```
