In this section, we present how to build a web crawler with MindsDB.

## Connection

This handler does not require any connection parameters.

Here is how to initialize a web crawler:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_web 
WITH ENGINE = 'web';
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/web_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

### Get Websites Content

Here is how to get the content of `docs.mindsdb.com`:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_web.crawler 
WHERE url = 'docs.mindsdb.com' 
LIMIT 1;
```

You can also get the content of subwebsites. Here is how to fetch the content from 10 subwebsites:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_web.crawler 
WHERE url = 'docs.mindsdb.com' 
LIMIT 10;
```

Another option is to get the content from multiple webistes.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_web.crawler 
WHERE url IN ('docs.mindsdb.com', 'docs.python.org') 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Get PDF Content

MindsDB accepts [file uploads](/sql/create/file) of `csv`, `xlsx`, `xls`, `sheet`, `json`, and `parquet`. However, you can utilize the web crawler to fetch data from `pdf` files.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_web.crawler 
WHERE url = '<link-to-pdf-file>' 
LIMIT 1;
```

For example, you can provide a link to a `pdf` file stores in Amazon S3.
