This is the implementation of the MariaDB data handler for MindsDB.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/documentation/) is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License. MariaDB is intended to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, library binary parity and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands, allowing it in many cases to function as a replacement for MySQL.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `mysql-connector`, a self-contained Python driver for communicating with MariaDB servers.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host IP address or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well.

* `ssl` indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`).
* `ssl_ca` is the SSL Certificate Authority.
* `ssl_cert` stores the SSL certificates.
* `ssl_key` stores the SSL keys.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/mariadb_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the MariaDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE maria_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'mariadb',
  parameters = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "mariadb",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM maria_datasource.example_table;
```
