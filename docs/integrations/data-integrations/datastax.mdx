This is the implementation of the DataStax data handler for MindsDB.

[DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/) Astra DB is a cloud database-as-a-service based on Apache Cassandra. DataStax also offers DataStax Enterprise (DSE), an on-premises database built on Apache Cassandra, and Astra Streaming, a messaging and event streaming cloud service based on Apache Pulsar.

## Implementation

DataStax Astra DB is API-compatible with Apache Cassandra and ScyllaDB. Therefore, its implementation extends the ScyllaDB handler and is using the `scylla-driver` Python library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the user to authenticate.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user.
* `secure_connection_bundle` is the path to the `secure_connection_bundle` zip file.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/datastax_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Astra DB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE astra_connection
WITH
    engine = "astra",
    parameters = {
        "user": "user",
        "password": "pass",
        "secure_connection_bundle": "/home/Downloads/file.zip"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM astra_connection.keystore.example_table
LIMIT 10;
```
