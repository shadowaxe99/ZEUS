This is the implementation of the Couchbase data handler for MindsDB.

[Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) is an open-source, distributed multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database software package optimized for interactive applications. These applications may serve many concurrent users by creating, storing, retrieving, aggregating, manipulating and presenting data.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `couchbase` library, the Python driver for Couchbase.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Couchbase server.
* `bucket` is the port to use when connecting with the Couchbase server.
* `user` is the user to authenticate with the Couchbase server.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user with the Couchbase server.
* `scope` is the scope to use for making queries based on a scoped context (equivalent to schema in MySQL). Defaults to `_default`.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/couchbase_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Couchbase server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE couchbase_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'couchbase',
    parameters = {
        "host": "localhost",
        "bucket": "test-bucker",
        "user": "admin",
        "password": "password"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM couchbase_datasource.collection;
```
